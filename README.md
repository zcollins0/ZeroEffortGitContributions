Zero Effort Github Contributions
===============================
A script to fake your github contributions. Randomization makes it look convincing.

###Usage:
- (Optional) Make a dummy repository for your automated contributions (must be empty)
- Run Contribs.py, enter inputs as prompted
- Run fillit.sh (takes a few seconds)

###Notes:
- Does not take into account previous commits on each day
