Zero Effort Github Contributions
================================
Arguably unethical.
A script to automate github contributions. Gotta make that bar all nice and green.

###Usage:
- (Optional) Make a dummy repository for your automated contributions (must be empty)
- Run Contribs.py, enter inputs as prompted
- Run fillit.sh
